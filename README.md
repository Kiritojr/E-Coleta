Ecoleta is a marketplace where it connects companies and entities that collect organic and inorganic waste to people who need to dispose of their waste in an ecological way.

Companies / entities can register through the web platform by sending:

* Entity name, email, whatsapp
* Image of the collection point
* Address so that it can appear on the map



In addition to selecting one or more collection items:

- Lamps
- Batteries
- Papers and cardboard
- Electronic waste
- Organic waste
- Kitchen oil

Users will have access to the mobile application, where they can:

- Browse the map to see the registered institutions
- Contact the entity via E-mail or WhatsApp
